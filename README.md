# outline-extension
Simple extension for Chrome to add a shortcut for Outline in the context menu.

# So... Why?
The internet is full of paywalls. If you don't already know yet, [Outline](https://outline.com) is a tool that allows you to read the content of articles protected by paywalls for free, just copy and paste the link into it and you're good to go (works almost all the time).

All fine and dandy, right? Except I'm a lazy person and this process of copying the link, switching tabs, pasting and clicking "Create outline" was a bit too much, so I've developed this Chrome extension just for the sake of making my life easier.

## How do I install this?
1. Download the contents of this repository to a folder.
2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions
3. Make sure the option "Developer Mode" is enabled.
4. Click on "Load unpacked extension".
5. Select the folder you've downloaded previously.

## How do I use this?
Access any article protected by a payload, right-click anywhere and select the option "Read in Outline".

## This sucks tbh
Well, that's too bad.
